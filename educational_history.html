		<h2>Education History</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Taylor Swift did not go to college as she was signed by Big Machine
			Records when she was 16 years old. While I strongly advocate having
			as much education as possible, and there may come a time when Taylor
			Swift decides to get her college degree, for right now I cannot imagine
			that college is a high priority. Especially when she just racked up 
			$185,000,000.00 in earnings in one year.</p>
			<br>
			<p> I admire Taylor for her talent and her determination. I believe that
			 she can be successful in whatever she sets her mind to doingâ€¦ by the way,
			  that applies for the majority of us.</p>
